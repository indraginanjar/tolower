# tolower

Actually i don't remember much about this, just found it while digging old files.

This program is intended to lower case the names of all files in the specified directory.

## Compile

Originally i use codeblock, but since it really a simple (so simple, like a snippet it is) single source file project it should be easy to compile in gcc with this command.

```
   gcc main.c -o tolower
```

## Running

To lower case all file names in current directory:

```
    lowercase
```

or:

```
    lowercase .
```

To lower case all file names in spesific directory:

```
    lowercase <path of the directory>
```
